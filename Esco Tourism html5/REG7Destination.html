  walk on a glass based floor on the edge of the exterior of the 37th floor of the building. It is like walking on the sky but
  with a harness attached to a cord. The view of the whole of Cebu City and neighboring island of Bohol are amazing from this level.

  <h3>Edge Coaster</h3>
  <figcaption>Get an adrenaline rush with the Edge Coaster. The Edge Coaster is a gliding coaster ride on a rail situated around the edge of the exterior of the 38th floor.
  The coaster that is facing outward the building tilts to 30 to 55 degrees to its front.  </figcaption>
  <figcaption>It has the same spectacular view of Cebu City and Bohol Island like the Skywalk Extreme. This adventure is exciting and scary for some, but not as scary if it would have been 
  a real roller coaster. However, the ride gives you that feeling when you are about to fall off a building. That alone is a scary thought; imagine actually being there experiencing
  that moment for 5 minutes. It is a must-try!
